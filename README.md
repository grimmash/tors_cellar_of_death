# Notes

## The Cave "Steps"
On the west/left side of the main cave area we have used landscape walls to allow movement but prevent vision between the upper an dlower areas of the cave.  Adjust as you see fit!

## The "Ledge"
The overlooking ledge in the main cave area is a one-way wall.  It allows movement and vision from the left to right, but not in the ohter direction.  Adjust as needed!

## The Window Wall Layer
I use doubled walls throughout.  The outer wall is set back from the actual physical edge for rooms and vase.  the inner wall is a window, effectively.  This allow the detail of the wall art to be fully seen by players, but still restricts their movement to the intended passable areas.  

In most cases the window wall sits closer to the playable area.  However, I found for the sharp corners of rooms and tunnels, extending the "real" wall outwards from the "background" to the "real" edge of a corner provides a pleasing compromise of show the maximum art possible whil still restricting vision.

Enjoy!
